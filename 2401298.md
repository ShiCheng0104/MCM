> **Summary**
>
> This study investigates tennis match dynamics through sophisticated
> statistical mod-- eling and a novel **Dual-Temporal** **Bayesian**
> **Network** approach. By analyzing Wimble-- don data, we address five
> key questions:

**Performance** **Metrics** **(Problem** **1)**: We introduce a
server/returner **reweighting** **strategy** to accurately evaluate the
performance of a player. We further utilize sliding window and **Area**
**Under** **Curve** **(AUC)** methods to ensure continuity and locality,
thus better capturing the fluctuations within the game.

> **Momentum** **Existence** **(Problem** **2)**: Rigorous hypothesis
> testing (**Ljung-Box** **Q** **Test** **and** **Runs** **Test**) fails
> to reject null hypothesis of complete randomness. But **instanta-**
> **neous** **winning** **rates** can reveal slight deviations from
> randomness, suggesting the presence of subtle momentum effects, albeit
> not overwhelmingly conclusive.
>
> **Momentum** **Prediction** **(Problem** **3)**: We take a 2--step
> approach. We first separate out the momentum effect by considering it
> as the **residual** of a **Naive** **Binomial** **Model**.
> Subsequently, we develop a **Dual-Temporal** **Bayesian** **Network**
> **Model** to predict this residual effect. The network incorporates
> various latent variables such as physiology, perception, and
> self--efficacy. An additional outcome of this model is the calculation
> of the importance of factors on momentum through the reduction of
> information entropy.
>
> **Predictive** **Analysis** **(Problem** **4)**: Our model is tested
> on the Wimbledon 2023 com-- petition, where it successfully predicts
> most match fluctuations. We analyze instances of failure and propose
> potential future enhancements. The model framework is also applied to
> an additional dataset of female tennis matches, revealing intriguing
> dif-- ferences. Most importantly, we generalize our data into a
> **universal** **framework** for predicting momentum in sports games.
>

Let's consider the change in the points difference between player 1 and
player 2 in a match, according to Wimbledon_featured_matches.csv data
set, we subtract p2_points_won data from p1_points_won to get points
difference, namely:

points difference = p1_points_won -- p2_points_won (1)

> This formula helps us visualize the flow of a match, as depicted in
> the graph below, which highlights points difference over time:

> Where two colored dotted lines have also been added: green represents
> the server from player 1 to player 2, and purple represents the server
> from player 2 to player 1.

A key observation is that the player currently serving has a higher
chance of win-- ning the point, especially when point number = \[20,
50\] or \[180, 220\] . However, the overall trend of points difference
remains relatively stable, regardless of who serves, indicating that
serving alone doesn't drastically shift match momentum. So, we cannot be
influenced by who is the server when we try to identify which player is
performing better at a given time in the match.

Assuming the outcomes of individual points are independent (an
assumption of our naive model), the likelihood of observing the data
from a single match between player 1 and player 2, where player 1 wins
n1 points and player 2 wins n2 points, can be represented as a binomial
distribution:

Due to the existence of latent variables in our model, we utilize the

models, where the model depends on unobserved latent variables.

A possible factor that significantly influences outcomes in tennis is
the personal play style of specific players, like surface preferences,
injury history. These can only be modeled through their historical
performances and can't be inferred through our current approach (i.e.
only consider players' rankings). A data--based integration of player's
personal information may further boost our model's performance.

> models and a Duel--Temporal Bayesian Network to quantify and pre--
> dict the influence of psychological and physiological factors on
> in--game performance. Our analysis suggests that while each point's
> outcome may appears statistically inde-- pendent to some extent, the
> Bayesian network we developed tells a richer story. It reveals the
> hidden threads of self--efficacy, strategy, and physiological
> responses that weave together to form the fabric of momentum.

> To enable players to harness the positive aspects of momentum while
> mitigating its pressures, we recommend following strategic pivots:
>
> 1\. **Consistency** **is** **Key**: Encourage players to minimize
> unforced errors; our findings link consistent play to maintaining
> momentum.
>
> 2\. **Aggressiveness** **Pays** **Off**: Advise players to assert
> dominance with net approaches and serves to build positive momentum.
>
> 3\. **Serve** **Smart**: Emphasize varied and accurate serving
> techniques to uphold momentum without risking double faults.

4\. **Build** **Resilience**: Cultivate players' mental fortitude,
essential for navigating the pressures of break points and shifting
tides within matches.

> 5\. **Lead** **to** **Succeed**: Strive for early leads; our model
> suggests this exerts
>
> psychological pressure on opponents, bolstering momentum for the
> leading player.

> We trust this memo provides a clear and actionable strategy for
> leveraging the con-- cept of momentum to your advantage. Implementing
> these recommendations could foster a competitive edge, vital for
> triumphing in the modern, fast--paced game of ten-- nis.
>
> Looking forward to seeing these strategies manifest in your players'
> enhanced per-- formance.
